# pnuemonia-detection



The project focuses on developing an accurate and efficient pneumonia
detection system using two pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs),
VGG16 and VGG19. The dataset used for the project comprises chest X-ray
images of patients with and without pneumonia. The images were preprocessed
and augmented to improve the model's performance. The VGG16 and VGG19
models, which were pre-trained on the Kaggle dataset, are used to extract features
from the preprocessed images. The model's performance is evaluated using various
evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results are
compared between the two models to determine which performs better in detecting
pneumonia. The ultimate goal of the project is to provide a reliable and accurate
tool for early detection of pneumonia, which can help in timely medical
intervention and improve patient outcomes. In this project, we have developed two
pre-trained models to detect the pneumonia using Kaggle dataset. VGG16 and
VGG19 pre-trained models have been used and have an accuracy of 96.26 and
95.32 respectively. The accuracy of the two models may vary when we train the
model with the vast number of chest X-ray images and report
